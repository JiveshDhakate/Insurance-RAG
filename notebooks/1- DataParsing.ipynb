      "“How to read and understand this benefit illustration? This benefit illustration is intended to show year-wise premiums payable and benefits under the policy, at two assumed rates of interest i.e., 8% p.a. and 4% p.a. Some benefits are guaranteed and some benefits are variable with returns based on the future performance of your insurer carrying on life insurance business. If your policy offers guaranteed benefits then these will be clearly marked “guaranteed” in the illustration table on this page. If your policy offers variable benefits then the illustrations on this page will show two different rates of assumed future investment returns, of 8% p.a. and 4% p.a.

(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (2), no insurer shall repudiate a life insurance policy on the ground of fraud if the insured can prove that the misstatement of or suppression of a material fact was true to the best of his knowledge and belief or that there was no deliberate intention to suppress the fact or that such misstatement of or suppression of a material fact are within the knowledge of the insurer: Provided that in case of fraud, the onus of disproving lies upon the beneficiaries, in case the policyholder is not alive.
